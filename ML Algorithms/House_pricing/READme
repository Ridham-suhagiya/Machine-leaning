PROJECT Description : 
Figuring out the price of the house using the features perent in the datasets

Dataset:
Dataset is been taken from kaggle
test.csv
train.csv

Code: 

simple Data cleaning process of the data set is done in both the test as well the train dataset.
by using different features the price of the house is been checked and analysed
and the ones which were not relevant to the problem are droped leaving us with the extracted features
Price of the house is been calculated using linear machine learning algorithem
and the accuracy of 70% apporx is obtained.


Improvments:

Imporvements in this project can be done with more carefully analysing the dataset
and also by using different algorithm such as deep learning algorithm(ANN) the accuracy of the model can be improved.
