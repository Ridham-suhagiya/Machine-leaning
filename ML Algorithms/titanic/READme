Project Description:

In the project the status of the persons ability to survive a given condition is done.
Every person sailing on the ship on the when titanic crashed onto the icburg ability is been calculated.

Data Description:

Data is taken from Kaggle

Test.csv
Train.csv


Approach: 

According to me after analysing the data, I felt like Age,Sex,Pclass and price were the important features to be taken care of 
and we in this project are not conserned with the rest of features.

In these Features there are null values present in the age column and to recover those null values I have
used a approach in which I have used the respect term on an individual in the ship to assume the age of the passenger.

Mehtodology: 

Two methods are used in this project 
1) Logistic Regression : Because the target data was in binary classification
2) SVM : To use the features to classify them and divide them into 2 categories (which is survive or not survive)

Results:

1) Logistice Regression : 77 %
2) SVM : 76%

Improvements:

By using confusion matrix to check the dependencies of a perticular feature to the problem 
and by using the appropriat algorithm such as randomforest will surely improve the problem.
